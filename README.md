# ENEE439D_SAR_Building
The files in this repository are final pieces of code we utilized in our capstone project. They are named according to their function. for example, SAR preprocessing phase was used to prototype our preprocessing algorithms and then eventually run the final preprocessing algorithms on the whole dataset. the .py files are the three files that we utilized for model training. We recommend that if you want to run any of these three files, to do so from the server where they are already located, as they require alot of computing power to run. Finally, we would have liked to include the trained saved models here as well, but they were too large to upload to github, so we instead included download links in the appendix of our final report.
